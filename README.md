# E-Commerce Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
In this project, we analyze e-commerce transaction data to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, revenue trends, and customer segmentation. The goal is to derive meaningful conclusions that can help businesses optimize sales strategies and improve customer retention.

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL)**: For querying and aggregating data
- **Python**: For data manipulation and visualization
- **Pandas**: To structure and analyze query results
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Data Analysis
### 1. Customer Payment Trends
We used SQL window functions to calculate the moving average of customer payments over their purchase history. This helps in understanding how customer spending patterns change over time.

### 2. Monthly Revenue Analysis
We analyzed revenue trends by aggregating payments on a monthly and yearly basis. This provides insights into seasonal trends and overall business growth.

### 3. First-time Customer Retention
By identifying the first purchase of each customer and tracking their subsequent orders within six months, we evaluated customer retention rates. This information is crucial for customer engagement strategies.

### 4. Top Customers by Payment Value
We ranked customers based on their total payment values each year using the **DENSE_RANK()** function. The top three customers per year were identified, helping businesses recognize high-value customers.

## Insights
- Customer spending patterns vary significantly, with some customers making higher-value purchases consistently.
- Revenue exhibits seasonal trends, with some months showing significantly higher sales.
- A significant percentage of first-time customers do not make repeat purchases within six months.
- Identifying top customers can help businesses target high-value users with personalized promotions.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Connect to a MySQL database with the e-commerce dataset.
3. Run the SQL queries to extract data.
4. Use Python scripts to analyze and visualize results.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the analysis to include product categories and regional sales trends.
- Implement predictive modeling for customer churn analysis.
- Automate the data pipeline for real-time insights.
